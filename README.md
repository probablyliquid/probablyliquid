- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @probablyliquid, a hobby programmer! I like to think of myself as the 'creative-programmer' ðŸ˜‚
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Computer Science, Machine Learning + DeepL, Web-Development, Game Dev.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and practising my Python skills

P.S. If you've reached here from my QR-Code, I'd like you to know that I most definitely made you go through that to show off my CSS skills. Well sure, I could have just provided you with a link, but let's face it... that is not what programmers do!

Thanks for reading!
